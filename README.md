# WeatherDashboard
An R Shiny App for displaying weather station data


This app based around the data generated by the Switchdoc SkyWeather2 project (https://github.com/switchdoclabs/SDL_Pi_SkyWeather2).

Has a tab displaying "current conditions" as well as a tab that displays plots for Temperature, Rainfall, Humidity, Light, AQI, Barometric Pressure, Wind speed and Direction. All of these plots can have the date range and temporal resolution controlled from inputs on the sidebar.
