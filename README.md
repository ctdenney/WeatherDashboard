# WeatherDashboard
An R Shiny App for displaying weather station data


This app based around the data generated by the Switchdoc SkyWeather2 project (https://github.com/switchdoclabs/SDL_Pi_SkyWeather2).

Has a tab displaying "current conditions" as well as a tab that displays plots for Temperature, Rainfall, Humidity, Light, AQI, Barometric Pressure, Wind speed and Direction. All of these plots can have the date range and temporal resolution controlled from inputs on the sidebar. 


This project assumes that you already have both a shiny server and the SQL database set up and configured. It is beyond the scope of this project or README to help set up or configure these services.
